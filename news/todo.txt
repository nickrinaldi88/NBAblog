-In services.py create a Post object through Post.objects create for each object you receive. 
-Find out how to clear out posts
-Find out why posts aren't printing to template

-Add subscription service 
    -Add user ability and ability to login 
    -Will have to create User model to store data in DB 
-Add tool to compare two players at the same time fetch data from bball reference 
-Maybe add ticker of latest news? (Top posts on reddit?)  
-Have background script run every specific interval to populate the DB 





^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^


TODO:
-Have a script fetching twitter and reddit API data over intervals of time. (Service.py)
-This script needs to post this data to our database (models.py). Otherwise, we're just posting the raw API data onto our page.
-Use tech with tim's react tutorial to design the frontend
-Then create user authentication(What should the user be able to do?)


-How our program should work:
    -User sends GET request to database to fetch posts which will appear on page. 
    -We store that data, being updated constantly. We're sending get requests to twitter and reddit, but
        it's different from the user sending a get request to us. 
    -Send GET Request to Twitter and Reddit to fetch data.
    -Store data in database
    -Send POST request of Data to front end


-Will have background task fetching the api data. Can we post this data into our database?

-REMINDER
    -views.py may have some error, because we're following Tim's tutorial and its a different project than ours. We just need a user to scroll our page, we're putting the posts on their screen. They don't need to host anything. Just keep this in mind if errors show up. 

1. Add scrolling-to-update functionality
2. Combine Reddit and Twitter news into one timeline
2. Add login/user functionality
2a. add ability to save posts
3. Random Stats bar (request, bball ref, etc.)
3a. Search Bar 
3b. Ticker at top of the page for betting odds
4. Add more misc features
5. Make the page pretty
6. Handle server errors

'''OVERHAUL'''
-May collect HTML data through Models, have like Modelfields be url: site.url, etc.
    -Model fields correspond to reponse objects
    -Store that data. Then fetch from Database. 
    
-So we'll have to fetch from database and place in our view.
